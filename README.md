## 🎯 How to Use This Repository

### 1️⃣ **Start with Arrays**
Begin with the Arrays folder and solve problems in sequence.

### 2️⃣ **For Each Problem:**
1. Open the `.md` file first - read the concept
2. Try to solve it on **GeeksForGeeks** first
3. Paste your solution in the `.java` file
4. Test on GFG until all test cases pass
5. Update [learning-tracker.md](learning-tracker.md)
6. Commit to GitHub

### 3️⃣ **Follow the Order:**
```
Arrays → Strings → Recursion → Searching → Sorting → Hashing
→ Two Pointers → Stack → Queue → Linked List → Trees → Graphs → DP
```

### 4️⃣ **Update Tracker Daily:**
Keep [learning-tracker.md](learning-tracker.md) updated with:
- Date started
- Date completed
- GitHub commit hash

---

## 🔥 Dual-Streak Strategy

Every solved problem creates:

| Platform | What Gets Updated |
|----------|------------------|
| **GeeksForGeeks** | Problem-solving streak |
| **GitHub** | Commit streak |
| **learning-tracker.md** | Progress log |

This builds **discipline** and creates **visible proof** for recruiters!
