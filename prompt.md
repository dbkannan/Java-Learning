# 📌 Java Interview Preparation System

**(GeeksForGeeks + GitHub Dual-Streak Method)**

## 🎯 Objective

I am a **Java beginner with basic fundamentals**, preparing **strictly for technical interviews**.

This GitHub repository serves as:

* My **structured learning system**
* My **daily practice & consistency tracker**
* My **public proof of serious interview preparation**

🚫 I will **not learn by reading theory alone**.
✅ I will learn **only by solving GeeksForGeeks problems**.

---

## 🚫 Absolute Rules (Must Be Followed Always)

1. **Nothing should exist only in chat**
   * Every explanation, problem, hint, and progress update must be documented inside this repository.

2. **Only GeeksForGeeks problems**
   * Every problem must include the **official GFG problem link**.

3. **No theory without a problem**
   * Every concept must immediately map to a coding problem.

4. **Interview-oriented DSA only**
   * Topics must follow interview progression:
     ```
     Arrays → Strings → Recursion → Searching → Sorting → Hashing
     → Two Pointers → Stack → Queue → Linked List
     → Trees → Graphs → Dynamic Programming → etc.
     ```

5. **Showcase consistency, not shortcuts**
   * Every solved problem must:
     * Increase my **GFG streak**
     * Create a **GitHub commit**
     * Be tracked in `learning-tracker.md`

## 📂 Mandatory Folder Structure (Must Be Followed Exactly)

```
/<Topic>/
│
├── <ProblemName>.java
├── <ProblemName>.md

learning-tracker.md
prompt.md
```

### 🔹 Example

```
Arrays/
├── ReverseArray.java
├── ReverseArray.md

learning-tracker.md
prompt.md
```

---

## 🧩 Java File Rules (`<ProblemName>.java`)

Each Java file **must be fully boilerplate-ready** and include:

* Package declaration (if applicable)
* Class declaration
* `main` method
* Input handling
* Output handling
* **Method signature exactly as required by GeeksForGeeks**

✅ I will **only write logic inside the required method**, exactly like GFG's editor.

Each Java file must clearly mention:

* Problem name
* Official GFG link
* Time complexity
* Space complexity
* Input format
* Output format

---

## 📘 Problem Documentation Rules (`<ProblemName>.md`)

Each problem **must have its own markdown file** with the following sections:

### 1️⃣ Concept Explanation (Short & Practical)

Explain briefly:

* **What** is the concept?
* **Why** interviewers ask it?
* **When** should it be used?
* **Where** it fits in DSA patterns?
* **How** to apply it in problems?

---

### 2️⃣ Problem Details

* Problem name
* **Official GeeksForGeeks link**
* Difficulty level
* Constraints
* Expected time & space complexity

---

### 3️⃣ Input / Output

* Input format
* Output format
* Sample test cases with explanation

---

### 4️⃣ Interview Notes

* Important edge cases
* Common mistakes
* Optimization ideas

---

## 📊 `learning-tracker.md` (Single Global Tracker)

There must be **only ONE tracker for the entire repository**.

It must track:

| Topic | Problem Name | GFG Link | Status | Date Started | Date Completed | GitHub Commit |
| ----- | ------------ | -------- | ------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------- |

Status values:

* `Not Started`
* `In Progress`
* `Completed`

🎯 Purpose:

* Resume learning anytime
* Maintain discipline
* Show proof of consistency to recruiters

---

## 🔁 Strict Learning Flow

1. Pick the next topic
2. Select **ONE GeeksForGeeks problem**
3. Solve it on **GFG first**
4. Create Java & MD files locally
5. Push solution to GitHub
6. Update `learning-tracker.md`
7. Move to the next problem (next day)

---

## 🔥 Dual-Streak Strategy (Core Principle)

Every solved problem must:

* Extend **GFG problem-solving streak**
* Create a **GitHub commit**
* Reflect in `learning-tracker.md`

This system builds:

* Discipline
* Interview readiness
* Recruiter-visible effort

---

## ❌ What Must Never Happen

* No random problems
* No skipping tracker updates
* No multiple trackers
* No theory-only content
* No solutions without passing all GFG test cases

---

## 🧠 Assistance Rules (Very Important)

* I will come for help **only when stuck**
* **Never reveal the solution immediately**

### 3-Hints Rule (Mandatory)

1. **Hint 1** – Very basic direction (thinking level)
2. **Hint 2** – Approach & pattern
3. **Hint 3** – Dry run of a sample input

➡️ **Only if I still can't solve**, then provide the full code.

🎯 Goal: **Deep understanding, not blind problem grinding**

---

## ✅ Post-Solution Validation Rule

Once I:

* Solve the problem on GFG
* Pass all test cases
* Paste my solution into the Java file

👉 You must:

* Review the code
* Validate correctness
* Point out improvements
* Highlight what is done well
* Suggest interview-level optimizations (if any)

---

## 🏁 Final Goal

By strictly following this system:

* I become **interview-ready**
* My GitHub becomes **living proof of DSA discipline**
* My GFG profile shows **consistent problem solving**
* Recruiters see **real effort, not certificates**
